# pyGTKosmos

is an opensource application that lets you send free sms using the myCosmos service of Cosmote.
It's written in Python using GTK+ toolkit for the graphical user interface.
Make sure you have installed the required libraries (python-httplib2, python-gtk2) in order to work properly.

To enable the service you have to send the sms "E" or "OPEN" from your Cosmote mobile to the recipient 54000.
Your username is your mobile number and your password is the one you receive upon service activation.
You can send up to 10 sms per day.
